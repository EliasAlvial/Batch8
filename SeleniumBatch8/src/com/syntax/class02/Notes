What is a WEbElement?
Anything we see on the webpage is considered to be a "WebElement"
    e.g buttons, dropdowns, textboxes, checkboxes

HTML
HyperText Markup Language

What is DOM?
DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a browser's internal view of the webpage.
Also called Developer's tools
Document -- can be stored in any document, like pdf, excel or word.
Object -- any line inside HTML is called an Object
Model --it is just a layout of the HTML file.

Locator:
is an address or a position of a webElement in the webpage

8 Locators:
-- id
-- name
-- className
-- linkText
-- partialLinkText
-- xpath
-- cssSelector
-- tagName

HTML scripting meanings:
purple -- tags
brown -- attributes
blue -- attribute values

Why do we need many locators
--Developers may not provide all the locators for elements
-- some locators might have duplicate values in the other nodes
-- Some locators may not be applicable to all the elements
        e.g LinnkText and Partial LinkText are only used for links
