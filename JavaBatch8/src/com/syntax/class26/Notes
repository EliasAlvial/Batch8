4 Pillars of OOP to support programming.
1)Inheritance
2) Polymorphism
3)Abstraction
4)Encapsulation
Abstraction:
    It is a process of hiding implementation details and showing
    only the important to the user
  In java we have two types of Abstraction
    1) Using the  Abstract class
    2) Using the Interfaces
  In have so far we have implemented the complete methods where we needed them.
