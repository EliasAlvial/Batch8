Yet another type of variable
1)Local
2)Instance variables
3)Static variables
local variables:
    any variable that is declared inside of a method, or a block(loop, if condition etc...)
    or inside of the constructor are called local variables.
Properties of local variables.
    we can not access them out side of the block
    for exampleif(2>1){
    int x+10 //this variable will not be accesible out side of the curly brackets of the if condition
    }
    x=20 CE
    2)As soon as we are done with this method these local variables are destroyed and the memory(RAM)
    is freed and is avaiable to be used by other proagrams which means they are very efficetn in managing the memory
    and that's ehy they are always recommended over instance variables

Instance Variables
    All of the variable which are declared outside of the methods or
    blocks or constructors but inside a class are called instance variables.
  Properties
    1)Memory is allocated inside RAM as soon as object of that class is created and it says
    in the memory unless we are done with the closing bracket
    2) they are highly discouraged because they are not efficient in handling memory(RAM).

Static Variables:
They are declared outside of the mthods, sonctructor and block of codes with static

Access modifiers:
    Access modigiers are just kerwords(Privte public protected)that help reduce
    so that no one else from other classes or packages can modify data.
Private:
    If we use Private access modifier with our vairables or methods we can only access
    we use it to protect critical information that we do not want to expose.

class Account{
private int balacne;

void depositMoney(){
if(boolean properChannel, int money){
balance=balance+money
}
}
}

class hacker{
balance=100000;//CE Cannot access

}

Default:
This is not a keyword it is a behaviour which is assigned to the methods or properties
anny access modifier.
package1
classs{
String car;

}

package 2
class family{
car="i am your little brother I am ussing your car today forgive if i destroy it"
}

if we do not specify any modifiers default behaviour will assign to our variable
and methods and they will only be avaiblable within the same package.
public:
    if we declare our methods or instance variables we can access
    them from anywhere; any package,or any class.

package1
class{
public String car;

}

package2
class family{
car="I am your just a random guy I am using your car today forgive ig i destroy it"
}
