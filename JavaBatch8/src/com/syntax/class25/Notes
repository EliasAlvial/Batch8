Final Keyword:
    final is a keyword in java that can be used with class, fields and methods
    if we have declared a class as "final" then no other class can inherit our class.
    example:

    final public class DemoClass{
    in number;
    democlass(int number){
    this.number=number
    }
    void printNumber(){
    sout number;
    }
    }


    public class ChildClass extends DemoClass{//here there will be a Compile Error/// cannot inherit from a final class

    }

    Benefits of 'final classes'
    1) Privacy
    2) A<-B<-C<-D....(A inheriting B, inheriting C etc...)
