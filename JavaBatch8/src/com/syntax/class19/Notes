Constructors:
    1) Is a special block of code/similar to a method that is executed when we create an object
     of a class
    2) The purpose of a constructor is to initialize our fields
    3) They must have the name that is the same as the name of the class
    4) Constructors do not have return types--not even void.
    5) we can pass arguments to our constructors just like we do for our methods
    similarities between constructors and methods
Similarities  between constructors and methods
    1)Both can have parameters
    2)Both can have access modifiers like private public and protected/default
Differences constructors and methods
    1)As we can use any name for our method we can not ise any name for our constructor
    they must have the same name as of our class
    2)Constructors can not return values as methods can
    3)Constructors are automatically called when an instance of the class is created.
When should use constructors?
When we want to control the initialization of our fields.
