Recap:
Access modifiers
private
protected, default
public
Access modifiers are used to the control the accesss to our class members
 like fields and  method
Private access modifier which is the moth restricted it allows to access our
 class members like method and instance variables/fields/properties from the
  same class only
Compiler converts your java code to the byte code which out JVM can understand
JVM takes the byte code and converts that code into a machine so that our computers can understand.

For example
class PrivateClass{

private int salary

private transferSalaryToEmpBankACC(){
//some code

}

}


protected/Default
Default is not a keyword word/ it is a behaviour which is assigned to our
 properties or methods if we do not specify any access modifier
 And these fields/properties/attributes or methods/behaviours are then only
 accessible with the same package
Public:
 Public is a keyword in java that controls the access to our fields and methods
  if we use this access modifier all of our methods and fields can be accessed
  from anywhere inside our code base
