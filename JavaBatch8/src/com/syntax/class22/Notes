Super Keyword:
    is a keyword in java that we can use to access immediat parent
    like fields, methods and constructors
Method overloading:
    1) is a way to utilizing methods with different parameters but same name
    2) allows a class to have more than one method having the same name,
       if their arguments are different.
 In java we can distinguish between different methods by method signature
 method signature is a combination of method name type of parameters that we are
 passing as an argument and the sequence of the parameters.

 we can create methods with the same name if we us the parameters to our methods have the
 below properties
    1) method should have different number of parameters

    print(){}
    print(String name){}
    print(String name, String address){}

    print(String name, String address, String phoneNumbers){}

    2) we can overload methods if we provide different types of parameters
    print(){}
     print(String name){}
     print(int num1){}

     print(double num1){}

     3) we can also overload our methods if we change the sequence of the parameters
      print(String name, int num, char c){}
      print(char c, String name, int num){}
      print(int num, char c, String name){}

      print(String name, String address, String phoneNumbers){}

      Note: by changing the return or the access modifiers we can NOT overload
      methods in Java
