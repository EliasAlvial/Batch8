Class 23

Overloading:
Occurs within ONE class
Name of the method is same but parameters are different
Purpose: Increases Readability of program
Return type can be same or different
It is an example of Compile time Polymorphism.

Overriding:
Occurs in TWO classes:
Super class and sub class i.e. Inheritance is involved.
Name and parameters both are the same.
Purpose: Use the method in the child class which is already present in Parent class.
Return type is always same.
It is an example of Run Time Polymorphism.
