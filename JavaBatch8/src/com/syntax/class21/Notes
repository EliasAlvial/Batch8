Inheritance:
    Is a mechanism in Java through which we can use the field and methods
    from one class to other classes without re-writing a single line
    of code / repeating the code from the class from which we are inheriting.
  Benefits of using inheritance:
    1)cleaner more efficient code for memory and execution
    2) It helps us reduce duplicate code
    3) save time
    4) reusing the same code again.
  Disadvantages:
    1) Classes are tightly coupled changes in parent class effect child class
    Class Parent{

    int Money;
    void print(){
    s-out"Money ="+Money
    }
    }

    class Child extends Parent{

    main(){
    Child chile=new Child();
    child.print();
    }
    }


    we can access our static fields and methods using class names and using objects
    of the class but using Class name is preferable because static methods and fields
    belong to the class and not to the objects
  SuperKeyWord:
    As we can use this keyword in java to refer to the current fields and methods we can use super keyword
    to access the fields and methods from immediate parent class.
    it is used in subclasses to access superclass members
